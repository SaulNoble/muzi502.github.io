What is the cost of lies?

It's not that we'll mistake them for the truth.

The real danger is that if we hear enough lies,then we no longer recognize the truth at all.

What can we do then?

What else is left but to abandon even the hope of truth and content ourselves instead with stories?

In these stories, it doesn't matter who the heroes are.

All we want to know is: who is to blame?

I've already trod on dangerous ground.

We're on dangerous ground right now,because of our secrets and our lies.

They're practically what define us.

When the truth offends, we lie and lie until we can no longer remember it is even there.

But it is still there.

Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth.

Sooner or later, that debt is paid.

我认识比你勇敢的人 胡米约克
I've know braver souls than you, Khomyuk.
他们面临抉择 却沉默以对
Men who had their moment and did nothing.
因为当关系到你和你所爱之人的生命
Because when it's your life and the lives of everyone you love,
你的道德信念便一文不值
your moral conviction doesn't mean anything.
不复存在
It leaves you.
那一刻 你只想躲过那一枪
And all you
